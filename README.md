### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**MrSchnack/MrSchnack** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently not working on any projects at the moment.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python and maybe ruby later on.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: If you want to get in contact with me you can hit me up on my email Philip.s.petersen@gmail.com
